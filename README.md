# Snakes and Ladders Game

Snakes and ladders is an ancient south Asian board game. It consists of 10X10 grid board which
contains some snakes and ladders at specific boxes/indexes. One hundred is the maximum and a must
to win score for each player. First player reaching 100 gets to win the game and is immediately
declared as first Winner.

Following are a few basic features of the game;
- **Dice Board**: A board that display the boxes. Each box can either contain a number (1-100) or a player’s
pawn and a special field to represent presence of snake head or leader tail.

- **Snakes**: Any player’s pawn landing at a special box which have snake head will result in a severe loss in
player score.

- **Leader**: Any player’s pawn landing at a special box which have leader tail will result in a significant
increase in player score.

## Board
The game board is implemented by using a 4D linked list (next, previous, up & down pointers):
- Each node next points to the next box containing the next number.

- Each node previous points to the previous box containing the previous number.

- Each node has the up pointer set to null by default except the special nodes which are in
path of a ladder. Such nodes up pointers formulate the complete leader path. Hence any
player landing at a special node with ladder tail flag will move up in the path with the help
of up pointers until it reaches the top of ladder.

- Each node has the down pointer set to null by default except the special nodes which are
in path of a snake. Such nodes down pointers formulate the complete snake. Hence any
player landing at a special node with snake head flag will move down in the path with the
help of down pointers until it reaches the tail of the snake.

## Player
The game can be played between any numbers of players (>=2). The turns of players will be handled by using Queues (Implement using Arrays). The game will not end until we have winners.

- 2 Players: Game will end when one player reaches 100.
- 3 Players: Game will end when we have first and second winner.
- 4 or greater: Game will end when we have first, second and third winner.

## Dice
The dice rolling will be a simple random number generator; which generate number from 1 to 6.

## Turn Rules
- Each player will have to get a 6 or 1 on dice roll exactly in order to enter the board. The very first 6 of each player will be considered 1 which means each player will start the game from box 1.

- A player gets to roll the dice again; if he gets a 6. Each dice roll will be pushed in the diceRoll Stack. Assume a player rolls 6, 6 & 4. The player pawn will move in accordance with the stack popped dice roll. In our case, player pawn will first move 4 boxes then 6 boxes and then 6 boxes.

- If a player roll consecutive 6 exactly three times; he will lose his current turn.

- However, if a player roll consecutive 6 exactly four times; next player will lose his turn. Assume Player B has turn after Player A. Player A rolled consecutive 6 exactly four times and then any number. Player B will end up losing his turn.

- If any player roll sum in a specific turn is divisible by three; the player turn queue will reverse itself. Assume, the player turn queue is as follows: <br><br> P1 | P2 | P3 | P4 <br><br> P1 rolls the dice and ends up getting the roll sum which is divisible by three. The player pawn will move according to the rule b, c & d. Once P1 has completed his turn, the turn queue will reverse itself: <br><br> P4 | P3 | P2 | P1 <br><br> Now the next turn will be of P4 and not P2.

## Board Layout
The game layout or map is read from the file map.txt where every cell is represented with its number and an 'S' or 'L' indicates a snake or ladder at that position.
